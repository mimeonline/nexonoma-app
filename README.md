# Nexonoma App — System Snapshot

This repository represents the **current application-layer snapshot**
of Nexonoma.

Nexonoma is a system-oriented knowledge platform focused on making
structures, relationships, and decision spaces explicit.

This codebase reflects a **deliberate point in time**, not a finished product.

## Why this repository exists

- to make architectural thinking visible
- to externalize structure and system boundaries
- to support discussion around clarity, navigation, and knowledge modeling

The emphasis is on **understanding the system**, not executing it.

## Status

Active development.  
Structural decisions are stable; details evolve.

Breaking changes may occur without notice.

## How to engage

This repository is intentionally **read-only in spirit**.

Issues are welcome for:

- questions about structure
- conceptual or architectural feedback
- terminology and clarity discussions

It is not intended for:

- feature requests
- pull requests
- usage support
